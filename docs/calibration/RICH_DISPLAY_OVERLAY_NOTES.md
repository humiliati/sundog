# Rich-Display Overlay Notes

Phase 10 of `docs/SUNDOG_V_GEOMETRY.md` uses these notes to keep the
optional vocabulary layers separate from the calibrated parhelion core.
Image 1 is the label key; images 2, 7, and 13 are the first tuning set.

## Artifacts

| image | overlay | role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1.Photometeor-jeff-mod_marked_red.jpg` | source annotation | Label key for CZA, supralateral, suncave Parry, upper tangent, Parry supralateral candidate, infralateral, parhelic circle, lower tangent, parhelia, 22° halo, and 46° halo. |
| `2.Photometeor-jeff_mod_red.jpg` | `overlays/p2.rich-vocabulary.overlay.png` | Clean modern version of the annotated display; strongest rich-vocabulary tuning source. |
| `7.625544777_10241089047341957_4435817776770420050_n.jpg` | `overlays/p7.rich-vocabulary.overlay.png` | High-sun / partial-visibility stress case. |
| `13.480859565_17934474635991868_323320248088719839_n.jpg` | `overlays/p13.rich-vocabulary.overlay.png` | Square social-crop / logo-crop tuning source. |

## Anchor Summary

| image | sun px | R22 px | parhelion offset | inferred h | note |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| p2 | `(567, 496)` | 182 | 192 | 18.6° | Reuses the clean multi-photo calibration anchor; dagger residuals are -1 px / -1 px. |
| p7 | `(1033, 946)` | 200 | 393 | 59.4° | Reuses the high-sun anchor; CZA should be treated as not applicable at this altitude even when the vocabulary overlay draws it. |
| p13 | `(557, 372)` | 210 | 220 | 17.3° | Rough hand anchor for social-crop morphology; dagger residuals are +6 px / +8 px against rough parhelion marks. |

All generated overlays now apply `--parhelic-y-offset-r22 = -0.05`, raising
the parhelic belt and dagger markers by 5% of the observed 22° halo radius.
This fixes a shared vertical belt residual without changing the 22°/46° halo
registration.

## Phase 10 Measurement Pre-Registration

Geometry resolution, 2026-05-13: Mesa's crossover note makes the residual
table and negative thresholds load-bearing for the next Phase 10 run.

- The `per-inversion-route` residual table lives in this file, alongside the
  per-photo overlay notes. It is a Phase 10 deliverable, not a separate
  document, because the route residuals need to sit next to the photo-level
  visibility classifications that determine whether each route is applicable.
- The quantitative `do not promote` thresholds are a Phase 10 blocker for
  promotion. If the thresholds are not written before an overlay run, that run
  is exploratory only and cannot move a primitive into default/logo language.
- Thresholds are evaluated at the image anchor scale and normalized by each
  photo's measured `R22`.

Pre-registered `do not promote` thresholds:

| candidate class | do not promote if... |
| --- | --- |
| Optional vocabulary primitive | feature residual is `>= 0.06 * R22` or `>= 12 px` on at least two eligible photos |
| Inversion route | route residual is `>= 0.04 * R22` or `>= 8 px` on at least two eligible photos |
| Coverage | fewer than two eligible photos show the primitive/route clearly enough to measure |
| Attribution metric | metric reports a linear "arc X contributes N%" score instead of a route/primitive residual |

`Eligible` means the feature is visible, uncropped enough to measure, and
inside its sun-altitude validity window. Hidden, cropped, or high-sun invalid
features are recorded as `not applicable`, not as failures.

## Per-Inversion-Route Residual Table

This table is the Phase 10 response to the mesa finding that forward and
inverse directions are not symmetric. Do not infer that a good parhelion-offset
fit makes every route good.

| route | p2 residual | p7 residual | p13 residual | promotion status | note |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| Parhelion offset → sun altitude | TODO | TODO | TODO | pending | Existing preferred route; measure left/right separately when both parhelia are visible. |
| CZA apex → sun altitude / visibility | TODO | not applicable | TODO | pending | Valid only below the CZA cutoff; p7 high-sun case should remain not applicable. |
| Tangent-arc curvature → sun altitude | TODO | TODO | TODO | pending | Watch for non-monotone curvature; do not collapse into total overlay fit. |
| Supralateral position → sun altitude | TODO | TODO | TODO | pending | Measure only where supralateral is visible/candidate, not where cropped. |

## Vocabulary Classification

| primitive | p2 | p7 | p13 | promote? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CZA | visible | not applicable / high sun | cropped or not visible | Core label yes, but hide by sun-altitude rule when applicable. |
| Supralateral arc | visible | candidate only | not visible / cropped | Keep as optional vocabulary; p2 carries the strongest evidence. |
| Upper tangent arc | visible | visible / broad | candidate | Promote as stable logo/animation shape language. |
| Lower tangent arc | visible near lower 22° contact | not clear | not clear | Annotation only until another clean low-sun source supports it. |
| Suncave Parry arc | visible/candidate using image 1 key | weak candidate | weak candidate | Candidate label only; useful for education, not logo default. |
| Parry supralateral arc | candidate in image 1 | not visible | not visible | Do not promote beyond optional annotation. |
| Infralateral arcs | visible on p2 periphery | not visible / cropped | not visible / cropped | Good vocabulary label; not a core logo layer unless the design brief wants a rich-display variant. |

## Design Consequence

For the Phase 11 characterized logo toolkit, the safe shape language is:

- core sun;
- 22° halo / iris;
- left and right parhelion glints;
- parhelic-circle sweep;
- upper tangent / eyelid arc;
- optional CZA for large or animated marks.

Hold these back as annotation-only layers unless a later pass finds stronger
support across multiple clean references:

- Parry supralateral;
- suncave Parry;
- lower tangent;
- infralateral arcs.

The logo can borrow the *idea* of rich halo vocabulary, but the default mark
should remain readable at small sizes and trace back to stable atlas
primitives.
