# Yang-Mills Pre-Registration Holding Pen

Roadmap: [`SUNDOG_V_YANG_MILLS.md`](../../SUNDOG_V_YANG_MILLS.md)
Lit-pass: [`YANG_MILLS_LITPASS_MEMO.md`](../../YANG_MILLS_LITPASS_MEMO.md)

Filed: **2026-05-29 (PT)**

Status: **Phase 0 domain lock filed 2026-05-29**. See
[`P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md`](P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md). This
directory remains the home for any future Yang-Mills pre-registrations
(Phase 1 runner manifests, Phase 2/3/4 phase specs, and any P0 amendments).
It still admits no runner code by itself.

## Filed Artifacts

- [`P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md`](P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md) —
  cell ladder, lattice slate, action, β slate, generator algorithms,
  burn-in / thinning / autocorrelation rules, signature vocabulary v1,
  held-out target vocabulary v1, seven-entry leakage controls battery,
  admission requirements, outcome-branch table, anti-scope-creep rule,
  public-language boundary, and external-reviewer category. Closes the
  five §11 open decisions in
  [`../../SUNDOG_V_YANG_MILLS.md`](../../SUNDOG_V_YANG_MILLS.md).
- [`PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md`](PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md)
  - runner manifest for the cheapest Abelian instrumentation cell:
  `U1_2D`, 16x16, beta 1.0, gauge-randomization and raw-link residual
  smoke only. No non-Abelian or certificate claim admitted.

## Required Next Artifact

The next artifact should be the minimal runner implementation and package
script required by
[`PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md`](PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md).
Do not implement SU(2), Phase 2 nearest-neighbor scoring, smearing,
blocking, topological observables, or 4D hooks in that runner.

## Guardrail

No Yang-Mills code run is admitted unless a phase manifest under this
directory exists, cites the P0 lock version, and fills every Admission
Requirement listed there. Exploratory notebooks or scratch checks, if
ever needed, must be labelled exploratory and cannot be cited as receipts.

## Current State

- 2026-05-29: holding pen opened.
- 2026-05-29: [`P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md`](P0_DOMAIN_AND_RECEIPT_LOCK.md)
  filed. Receipt template at
  [`../../yang-mills/RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md`](../../yang-mills/RECEIPT_TEMPLATE.md)
  and receipts dir at
  [`../../yang-mills/receipts/`](../../yang-mills/receipts/) stood up.
  No runner code yet.
- 2026-05-29: Phase 1 U(1) 2D gauge-invariance smoke manifest filed at
  [`PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md`](PHASE1_U1_2D_gauge_invariance_smoke.md).
  The next move is runner implementation against that exact manifest.
