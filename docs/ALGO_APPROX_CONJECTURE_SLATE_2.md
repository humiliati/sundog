## Tier legend

- **[FORMALIZABLE]** — a Lean target on the existing
  `CircuitNet`/`StraightLineCost`/`RegionCount`/`CancellationFree`/`DepthSeparation`
  surface; could become an axiom-clean core.
- **[IMPORT-AND-CHECK]** — the classical theorem exists; the work is verifying the
  bridge is faithful *and naming exactly where it breaks*.
- **[EMPIRICAL]** — a runnable frontier-ML experiment with a falsifiable prediction.
- **[SYNTHESIS]** — a retrospective organizing claim over results already in hand;
  falsifiable in principle, but framing more than a single Lean/experiment target.
- **[DAYDREAM]** — general/ambitious; mapped to mark the frontier, not yet actionable.

## The spine — cancellation is the controlling coordinate

A ReLU net is a tropical **rational** map (`relu` + affine = max-plus *with*
subtraction); the cleanly-transferable classical results live over tropical
**polynomials** (monotone, no cancellation). Slate 1 kept hitting that one seam
from four directions:

- **C-B1** — monotone (cancellation-free, `IsMono`) ⊊ general ReLU. The
  monotone-vs-general / natural-proofs wall *is* cancellation: tropical-polynomial
  vs tropical-rational. `abs = max(x,−x)` is the witness that needs the negative
  scale.
- **C-C2** — the two fine-grained cornerstones that fell **outside** the tropical
  cost-family were **3SUM** (additive cancellation) and the **`n^ω`** matmul route
  (Strassen's subtractive cancellation). Everything cancellation-free unified;
  the cancellation problems didn't.
- **H-A1 / H-A2** — exact compilation worked precisely on the cancellation-free PL
  fragment; the analytic gates (reciprocal, radical) — the division/cancellation
  gates — are exactly where exactness broke and `ε` entered.
- **C-D1** — the tent's `2^d` regions come from `abs = max(x,−x)`, which *requires*
  the negative scale. Folding needs cancellation.

So one predicate — **does the computation cancel?** — seems to sit under hardness
(C-B1), fine-grained membership (C-C2), exact-vs-`ε` (H-A1/A2), and depth's
expressivity (C-D1). The four hooks below test whether that spine is real.

## N-1 — Monotone depth is region-*polynomial*; cancellation depth is region-*exponential*. [FORMALIZABLE] *(the gem)* — **FULLY CLOSED** 2026-06-28/29 (axiom-clean), `Sundogcert/FoldCancellation.lean` + `Sundogcert/PieceCover.lean` + `Sundogcert/RegionPoly.lean`. Sharp form + qualitative + quantitative composition (depth axis) + **tight circuit-level `isMono_hasPieceCover` (linear in leaves)** all machine-checked.

*Claim.* For a cancellation-free (`IsMono`) circuit, depth cannot create
exponentially many linear regions: a depth-`d`, width-`w` `IsMono` circuit
realizes a function with `O(d·w)` linear regions. The exponential expressivity of
depth (the tent's `2^d`) **requires** cancellation. Equivalently: **folding — and
hence all exponential expressivity from depth — requires cancellation.**

*Mechanism (why it should be provable, 1-D).* An `IsMono` circuit computes a
**monotone** (non-decreasing) function (`monotone_of_isMono`, already proved in
`CancellationFree.lean`). Compose a monotone outer `g` (`m` pieces) with a monotone
inner `h` (`n` pieces): the breakpoints of `g∘h` are the breakpoints of `h` plus
the points where `h` hits a breakpoint *value* of `g`. Because `h` is monotone,
each such value is hit at a **single** point (generically), so pieces **add**:
`pieces(g∘h) ≤ n + (m−1)`. Iterate over depth `d` ⇒ `O(d·w)` regions. The tent is
**non-monotone** (it folds via `abs`), so each outer breakpoint value is hit at
**two** inner points (up-leg and down-leg) ⇒ pieces **multiply** ⇒ `2^d` (exactly
`tent_iterate_dyadic`). Monotonicity is the no-fold condition, and `IsMono` is the
no-cancellation grammar, so the two coincide.

*Traction / what fuses.* This is a single positive theorem that unifies three
landed cores: **C-A1** (`RegionCount.lean`, regions as an exact intrinsic) +
**C-B1** (`CancellationFree.lean`, `monotone_of_isMono`) + **C-D1**
(`DepthSeparation.lean`, the tent's `2^d`). The Lean target: a new lemma
`isMono_regionCount_add` / `isMono_regions_poly` — "the 1-D region count adds (not
multiplies) under composition of `IsMono` circuits," on the same 1-D surface
`realize1_compile` already lives on. `monotone_of_isMono` is the hypothesis;
the breakpoint-pullback argument is the proof.

*Classical hook.* Depth separations (Telgarsky); monotone-circuit expressivity;
"depth = computation" — sharpened to "depth = computation **only with**
cancellation."

*Falsifier* (`MONOTONE_FOLDS`): a cancellation-free (`IsMono`) circuit whose 1-D
linear-region count is super-polynomial in depth. A single such witness ends it.

*Result — SHARP FORM LANDED 2026-06-28, axiom-clean (`Sundogcert/FoldCancellation.lean`,
`lake build` green, deps only `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).* The tightest
form of the contrast is machine-checked: **no cancellation-free circuit computes the
`d`-fold tent for `d ≥ 1`** (`isMono_not_iterTentFun`, and `isMono_not_iterTent` against
the circuit), via **`isMono_no_fold`** — a monotone circuit cannot be `1` at `1/2^d` and `0`
at the larger `2/2^d`. It fuses `monotone_of_isMono` (C-B1) with `tent_iterate_dyadic` (C-D1):
the *same witness* that achieves `2^d` regions is **unrealizable cancellation-free**, so the
exponential expressivity of depth is cancellation-essential — "depth = computation **only with
cancellation**."

*Positive half — QUALITATIVE CORE LANDED 2026-06-28, axiom-clean (same module, same gate).* The
mechanism — *monotone cannot fold, at any level* — is now machine-checked, lifting `isMono_no_fold`
from one witnessed fold to **every** level: **`isMono_realize1_monotone`** (the 1-D realization of an
`IsMono` circuit is `Monotone`, from `monotone_of_isMono`) ⇒ **`isMono_superlevel_isUpperSet`** (every
super-level set `{x | c ≤ f x}` is an `IsUpperSet` — once `f` reaches `c` it never returns below it, i.e.
exactly one rising crossing per level, **no oscillation**). The matching contrast
**`tent_superlevel_not_isUpperSet`** shows the tent's `{x | 1/2 ≤ T^[2] x}` is *not* an upper set
(`1/4` in, `1/2` out), so no `IsMono` circuit has the tent's level structure — folding *is* the
upper-set failure. This is the structural reason monotone region counts stay small (pieces *add*, they
cannot *multiply*).

*Quantitative half — COMPOSITION CORE LANDED 2026-06-28, axiom-clean (`Sundogcert/PieceCover.lean`,
9th Lean module, in the AxiomAudit gate).* Built via the **safer target**: instead of defining the
exact tropical-chamber count (the C-A1-deferred cardinality), a **bounded piece certificate**
`HasPieceCover f k` (`f` is affine off a finite cut set of size `≤ k−1`, i.e. `≤ k` affine pieces) —
an *upper bound* on the region count with no exact chamber object. On it, the load-bearing lemma is
machine-checked: **`hasPieceCover_comp_mono`** — `HasPieceCover h n → HasPieceCover g m → Monotone h →
HasPieceCover (g ∘ h) (n + m)`: composing a **monotone** inner map makes pieces *add*. The proof is
exactly the mechanism the draft predicted — monotonicity pins each `g`-cut's preimage to a single
upward ray (`{x | β ≤ h x} = Ici (crossing)`), so crossings can't multiply. Iterating gives the
headline **`hasPieceCover_iterate`**: a monotone map with `k` pieces composed with itself `d` times has
`≤ d·k + 1` pieces — **linear in depth**, the exact quantitative contrast to the tent's `2^d`
(`DepthSeparation`). So monotone depth is region-*polynomial*; cancellation depth is
region-*exponential* — now a theorem on the 1-D depth axis.

*Circuit-structural lift — PHASE 1 LANDED 2026-06-28, axiom-clean (`Sundogcert/RegionPoly.lean`,
10th Lean module, gated).* Toward a fully general `isMono_regions_poly` over *arbitrary* `IsMono`
circuits: the **convexity bridge** **`isMono_realize1_convexOn`** (every cancellation-free circuit's
1-D realization is `ConvexOn ℝ univ` — `var`/`const`/`add`/nonneg-`scale`/`max` all preserve
convexity) plus the two cut-based gate lemmas that need no convexity — **`hasPieceCover_add`** (`+` is
piece-additive, `n + m`, cuts union) and **`hasPieceCover_smul`** (scaling preserves the cut set, `n`).

*The convex-merge linchpin (B) — LANDED 2026-06-29, axiom-clean, gated (`hasPieceCover_max_line`).*
The hardest analytic lemma is machine-checked: **adding one line to a convex function adds at most one
piece** — `ConvexOn h → HasPieceCover h k → HasPieceCover (fun x => max (ℓ x) (h x)) (k+1)`. The proof
realizes the full convex-merge: `{x | h x ≤ ℓ x}` is order-connected (a direct convex-combination
argument, no `ConcaveOn`-of-affine needed); split on `BddBelow`/`BddAbove` into ∅ / `univ` / ray /
bounded; and the **bounded case is the absorption** — either `h` carries a breakpoint inside `(α,β)`
(so the two new endpoint cuts are paid for by removing it, `card ≤ k`) or `h = ℓ` on `[α,β]` and
`max = h` globally. Uses convex continuity (`ConvexOn.continuousOn`), `sInf`/`sSup`-membership in the
closed agreement region, and closure boundary values. This `+1` (not `+2`) is exactly why monotone
depth stays polynomial.

*Circuit-level tight `isMono_regions_poly` — **COMPLETE** 2026-06-29, axiom-clean, gated
(`Sundogcert/RegionPoly.lean`, 10th module).* The full N-1 dichotomy is machine-checked:

> **`isMono_hasPieceCover`** : `IsMono e → HasPieceCover (realize1 e) (leafCount e)` — every
> cancellation-free circuit's 1-D realization has a linear-region count **linear in the number of
> leaves** (polynomial in circuit size).

The whole pipeline landed: **bridge** `isMono_realize1_convexOn` (cancellation-free ⟹ convex) ·
cut gates **`hasPieceCover_add`** (`n+m`) / **`hasPieceCover_smul`** (`n`) · the convex-merge
linchpin **`hasPieceCover_max_line`** (line + convex ⟹ `+1`, with the bounded-case absorption) ·
**`lineBelow`** (supporting line, via `ConvexOn.slope_mono_adjacent`) · **(A)
`convex_eq_sup_lines`** (a convex `HasPieceCover`-`n` function is the max of its `≤ n` piece-lines —
done by the cut-set secant enumeration with `min'`/`max'` and the unbounded-piece extensions, *not*
the peeling route) · **`hasPieceCover_max`** (convex-convex `max` is `n+m`, by folding the linchpin
over (A)'s line set) · and the **circuit induction** `isMono_hasPieceCover` (the `max` gate is the
only one needing convexity). 9 RegionPoly theorems gated. **N-1 is now closed on BOTH axes**: the
depth/composition axis (`PieceCover`, linear-in-depth) and the full circuit-structure axis
(`RegionPoly`, linear-in-leaves) — monotone is region-polynomial, the (cancellation) tent is `2^d`.

## N-2 — Cancellation is the single imported-wall coordinate. [SYNTHESIS] — **WRITTEN + ANCHORED** 2026-06-29: `docs/ALGO_APPROX_N2_CANCELLATION_SPINE.md` + `Sundogcert/CancellationSpine.lean`.

*Result — DELIVERABLE COMPLETE 2026-06-29 (the claim stays a typed conjecture, not promoted).*
The retrospective is written with a disciplined PROVEN-vs-organizing-reading split, and rests on
a Lean anchor (the slate's own condition: pursue *after* N-1 gives fold↔cancellation a proof).
**Machine-checked half:** `CancellationSpine.isMono_tame` — a cancellation-free circuit is
*uniformly tame* (monotone **and** convex **and** region-polynomial), all from `IsMono`; paired
with the negative `FoldCancellation.isMono_not_iterTent` (the cancellation-using tent is
unreachable cancellation-free). So on the monotone / convex / region / fold axes, cancellation
*is* the coordinate, earned. **Organizing-reading half:** the 3SUM (additive), `n^ω`
(subtractive), and analytic-gate (division) walls are *typed* by cancellation by analogy, with
**no** formal reduction — they stay a lens, not a theorem. The honest limit: "cancellation-
reducible" lacks a precise common definition across the four axes, and promoting it would need
the imported walls themselves formalized (out of reach by the same wall the lane respects).
Falsifier `WALL_WITHOUT_CANCELLATION`: **not fired** (no cancellation-free wall found), but
absence ≠ proof.

*Claim.* *Every* imported wall in the lane — the monotone-circuit lower bound
(C-B1), 3SUM and the `n^ω` route (C-C2), the analytic/division gates (H-A1/A2),
and the depth-vs-width bound (C-D1) — is reducible to one predicate: **the target
requires cancellation.** If true, the lane's entire hardness-import surface
collapses to a single coordinate, and every "imported wall" is the same wall.

*Traction.* It would retro-organize the whole lane: instead of five distinct named
imports, one — "cancellation-required" — with the others as instances on different
axes (additive: 3SUM; subtractive/algebraic: `n^ω`; division: analytic gates;
fold: depth). It also predicts the *shape* of any future wall the lane meets:
ask first whether the target cancels.

*Classical hook.* Monotone vs general circuits; the natural-proofs barrier as the
"cancellation is where lower bounds stop being natural" statement.

*Falsifier* (`WALL_WITHOUT_CANCELLATION`): an imported wall the lane genuinely
relies on that is provably **not** cancellation-reducible — a hardness the
cancellation-free fragment also exhibits. One such wall falsifies the collapse.

*Honest tier note.* More framing than theorem: "reducible to cancellation" needs a
precise common definition that covers additive / subtractive / division / fold on
equal footing, or it stays an elegant retrospective rather than a result. Best
pursued *after* N-1 gives the fold↔cancellation half a proof.

## N-3 — The find/check ledger is a general certificate theory. [FORMALIZABLE] — **COMPLETE** 2026-06-29 (axiom-clean, gated): `Certifies.lean` + `MaxFlowMinCut.lean` + `MatchingCover.lean` + `TwoSat.lean` + `PrattCert.lean`.

*Result — COMPLETE 2026-06-29.* The `Certifies` abstraction is built around the reusable
**LP-duality core `weakDuality_tight`**: weak duality (every primal `≤` every dual) + a
*tight pair* (`p = d`) ⇒ `IsGreatest P p ∧ IsLeast D d` (both optima at once) — axiom-free, the
purest certificate core. All four candidate instances landed, spanning three cert *shapes*:

> - **max-flow / min-cut** (`MaxFlowMinCut.lean`) — LP-dual optimization: `weak_duality`
>   (`value F ≤ capCut cap S`; conservation collapses the `S`-sum to the source's net out-flow,
>   the within-`S` double sum cancels by skew-symmetry, across-cut flow `≤` capacity) +
>   `maxflow_mincut` (tight pair ⟹ both optima, via `weakDuality_tight`).
> - **König** (`MatchingCover.lean`) — LP-dual optimization: `matching_le_cover` (a cover
>   upper-bounds every matching, via an injection matched-edge ↦ cover-endpoint) + `konig`.
> - **2-SAT** (`TwoSat.lean`) — *decision* / NP-verification: `check_correct` (the `O(|φ|)`
>   evaluator decides the language) + `cert_sound` (a satisfying assignment certifies
>   satisfiability). Axiom-light (`[propext, Quot.sound]` — the eval is decidable).
> - **Pratt** (`PrattCert.lean`) — *number-theoretic* succinct cert: a primitive-root `Witness`,
>   `cert_sound`/`cert_complete`/`prime_iff_witness` (primality is in NP), wrapping mathlib's
>   `lucas_primality` / `reverse_lucas_primality`.

Each plugs into the shared ledger via a `Certifies.Ledger` instance with an `O(·)` cheap-check
theorem. The ledger is now **7 instances** (syndrome / shortest-path / ReLU gate-count /
max-flow-min-cut / König / 2-SAT / Pratt), unified under one `Certifies`/`StraightLineCost`
interface — check cheap, find imported, across optimization, decision, and number-theoretic
problems. **N-3 closed.**

*Claim (original).* The three `StraightLineCost` instances (syndrome / shortest-path / ReLU
gate-count) are cases of one structure: **a witness whose verifier is a cheap
straight-line program, soundness proved, find-hardness imported.** Generalize to a
`Certifies` class and spawn new instances — each a small Lean cert module like
`ShortestPathCert`. Conjecture: a broad class of P/NP problems carry tropical/PL
verification certificates expressible in the ledger.

*Candidate instances (each a buildable module).* **max-flow / min-cut**
(LP-duality cert: a cut certifies a flow's optimality) · **bipartite matching**
(König / a vertex cover certifies a maximum matching) · **2-SAT** (the
implication-graph SCC certificate) · **Pratt primality** (the classic succinct
NP certificate). Each gives another `HasStraightLineCost` instance and another
`O(·)` cheap-check theorem.

*Traction.* The most *buildable* hook on the slate — it extends the proven
`ShortestPathCert` pattern (`feasible_le_walk` dual bound + `cert_isLeast` exact
optimality) to new domains, each closing as its own axiom-clean module. Grows the
ledger from 3 to N instances and tests the breadth of "check is cheap, find is the
imported wall."

*Classical hook.* Certifying algorithms; the NP "verification is easy" half,
machine-checked across optimization and decision problems; LP duality / König /
implication graphs.

*Falsifier* (`VERIFIER_NOT_PL`): a natural certifying problem whose verifier is
**not** straight-line / PL-expressible in the ledger — the certificate exists but
the cost model can't carry it. Names the boundary of the ledger's reach.

*First move.* Pick one (max-flow/min-cut is the cleanest LP-dual mirror of
`ShortestPathCert`) and write the module: a `Cut`/`Feasible` structure, a
`weak-duality` lower-bound lemma, the exact-optimality capstone, and the
`HasStraightLineCost` instance.

## N-4 — The `ε`-essential region count is the *learnable* invariant. [EMPIRICAL] — **REDEEMS** 2026-06-29: `scripts/algo_approx_n4_eps_regions.py` + `docs/ALGO_APPROX_N4_EPS_REGIONS_RESULT.md`.

*Result — REDEEMS 2026-06-29 (with a named residual; falsifier did NOT fire).* The trained
generalization-width threshold tracks **(ε-essential − 1)** at **32/36 = 0.89** across families
and bars, vs only **18/36 = 0.50** for **(exact `k` − 1)**; and the ε-essential count **moves
with the bar** (mean spread 1.33; exact `k` spread 0). The convex families (smooth, essential)
track the ε-essential count **exactly** (1.00), which *explains* the C-D2 mystery — they
generalize at `≈ ε-essential ≪ k`, with `k` the `bar → 0` limit. Method: optimal DP PL
segmentation for the ε-essential count (recomputed per bar) + a best-of-6-restarts fitting
**oracle** for the threshold (the lever against C-D2's trainability confound). **Honest residual:**
the non-convex jagged family tracks at 0.67 (one outlier, `k=5`: the oracle still can't ε-fit
below width 5 though ε-essential says 2–3) — C-D2's **existence ≠ trainability** confound,
surviving on non-convex shapes. So N-4 **redeems confound (1)** [exact-vs-ε: ε-essential is the
right geometric invariant] and **cleanly isolates confound (2)** [trainability]: generalization
onset = ε-essential region count **modulo** SGD trainability. C-D2's documented null is now a
positive — region geometry *is* the predictor, read at the operative scale.

*Claim.* C-A1 proved the **exact** region count is an intrinsic invariant; C-D2
found it does **not** drive generalization (`ε`-approximability + trainability did,
not exact `k`). The redemption: an **`ε`-smoothed** region count — counting only
regions *wider than `ε`* — *is* the generalization predictor. The exact-vs-`ε` seam
that confounded C-D2 becomes the measured quantity.

*Traction.* Turns C-D2's documented INCONCLUSIVE into a sharp, testable positive on
the same harness: re-run the threshold sweep measuring `ε`-essential pieces instead
of exact `k`, and test whether `threshold ~ (ε-essential count)` where it failed to
track exact `k`. Directly tests the lane's standing "exact size ≠ `ε`-complexity"
confound as a hypothesis rather than a footnote.

*Classical hook.* Effective / `ε`-region complexity vs exact region count; the
approximation-theoretic side of expressivity; generalization bounds keyed to
*effective* rather than exact capacity.

*Falsifier* (`EPSILON_REGIONS_ALSO_FAIL`): the `ε`-essential region count also fails
to track the trained-generalization threshold (or tracks no better than the exact
`k` it replaces) → region geometry, smoothed or not, is not the learnable invariant
and the operative quantity is purely trainability.

*First move.* Reuse the C-D2 grokking harness; add an `ε`-essential piece counter
(merge adjacent pieces whose width `< ε`), sweep `ε`, and re-fit `threshold(k)`
against the `ε`-essential count. Decouple the trainability confound with the
fitting-oracle step C-D2 already named as its honest next move.

## What this slate is NOT

- **Not a Millennium attack.** Scope = tropical / piecewise-linear / monotone
  computation and ML theory. The cancellation spine is a *typed coordinate* over
  the lane's own results, not a route to an unconditional separation.
- **Not an unconditional P-vs-NP claim.** N-1 is a lower bound *in the
  cancellation-free model* (it says depth can't help *there*); it does not bound
  general nets, which is exactly the natural-proofs boundary the lane respects.
  N-2/N-3 keep find-hardness imported.
- **Not promoted without receipt.** Tiers are aspirations; a hook stays PROPOSED until
  a Lean core or an experiment receipt lands. Slate 1's discipline carries over
  unchanged.

## Recommended next attacks (post N-1)

**Closed reference:** **N-1 is fully closed** across all three rungs: the sharp
negative half in `FoldCancellation.lean`, the depth/composition positive half in
`PieceCover.lean`, and the arbitrary-circuit linear piece bound in
`RegionPoly.lean` (`isMono_hasPieceCover`). The slate should now treat N-1 as a
machine-checked theorem cluster, not as an active target.

1. **N-3 — the safest builder. [FORMALIZABLE]** If the goal is more Lean closures,
   this is the highest-yield next move: a general `Certifies` class plus new
   certificate modules (max-flow/min-cut first) on the proven `ShortestPathCert`
   pattern, growing the find/check ledger with low risk.
2. **N-4 — the empirical redemption. [EMPIRICAL]** Cheapest to run and it converts a
   documented null into a falsifiable positive on an existing harness; do it when
   you want a measured result rather than another proof.
3. **N-2 — the elegant retrospective. [SYNTHESIS]** Highest framing value, and now
   better grounded: N-1 supplies the theorem backbone for the fold↔cancellation
   half. It still needs a uniform definition of "reducible to cancellation" across
   the four axes before it should be promoted as more than synthesis.
